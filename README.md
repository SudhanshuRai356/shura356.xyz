#  Sudhanshu Rai (shura356) — Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hey! I'm Sudhanshu Rai, but you might know me as **shura356** from CTFs and the cybersecurity community. This is my personal portfolio — a retro cyberpunk space where I share my journey, projects, and what i have found to be interesting.

> "Learning through practice — breaking systems to understand how to defend them better."

## What is this?
A portfolio, sure — but also a playground. I built this site to showcase my real work, my real progress, and the things I actually care about. No fake stats, no corporate buzzwords. Just my story, my skills, and a bit of fire.

##  Highlights
- **Retro cyberpunk theme** — neon glows, fire colors, and a bit of attitude
- **Built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS**
- **Framer Motion** for smooth, fun animations
- **Fully responsive** — looks good on your phone, your laptop, or a CRT if you're into that
- **One stat that matters:** FIRES STARTED: ∞

##  What's Inside

### Hero Section
- Animated grid, floating fire particles, and my name (plus my CTF alias)

- One big, bold stat: FIRES STARTED: ∞

### About Section
- My real story: how I got into cybersecurity, what I'm learning, and why I love it

### Projects

## About Me
I'm a 2nd year B.Tech CSE (Cybersecurity) student from India. I love breaking things (ethically), learning by doing, and competing in CTFs as **shura356**. My proudest moments so far: interning at CliffGuard, getting Google certified, and ranking in the top 6% at HTB Tales of Aldoria and 26th at ApoorvCTF 2025.
